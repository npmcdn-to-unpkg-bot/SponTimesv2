Sera Blue is a New Age publishing company based in Johannesburg South Africa.

We offer a range of services to authors from traditional publishing to subsidy publishing to editing and cover designs, to name just a few options. Whatever your needs, they can be met here. 

Currently we publish young adult books, children’s books, graphic novels and more.

There’s a little something here for everyone -horror through to romance, book layout through to ISBN registeration, even advice on unfinished manuscripts through to full publishing services where we handle all the legal work so you can simply follow your passion of writing or illustrating.
