					<h3>Elements of Night</h3>
					<p>“I took your Life,” Death speaks through her; the demonic sound shakes even   the heavens, “And replaced it with something better.”</p>
					<p>The Ca’em released a deadly terror into the world. The witch hunter’s army of beasts will either defeat  what was reborn in the darkness or distract them long enough for the Ca`em to flee East.</p>
                                        <p>Tannah and Neel share a burdened past, one that even the strength of  their friendship cannot bring them to admit the truth to each other. But when  a girl is killed, they stumble down a path where they must come to terms with  their past or face repeating it.</p>
